<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<i>r.terrace.geom</i> flexible terrain analysing tool is developed for the delineation and quantifiable analysis of terrace remnants. <br>
The algorithm determines cells potentially belonging to terrace surfaces based on local slope characteristics and a minimum area size threshold.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The algorithm cuts up the area into parallel sections in flow direction and determines cells belonging to terrace-like surfaces. <br>
As a result an output report is created that contains a histogram of altitudes, a swath profile of the landscape, scatter plots <br>
to represent the relation of the relative elevations and slope values in the analysed sections and two final plots showing the <br>
longitudinal profile of the river with the determined height ranges of terrace levels and a histogram of the values.
